  App Engine Routing.

  Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version,
  and instance.

  For more information about services, versions, and instances see
  [An Overview of App
  Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine),
  [Microservices Architecture on Google App
  Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine),
  [App Engine Standard request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed),
  and [App Engine Flex request
  routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).

  Using AppEngineRouting requires
  [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
  Google IAM permission for the project
  and the following scope:

  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`

  ## Attributes

  *   `host` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The host that the task is sent to.

      The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with
      the queue's project ID (for example <app-id>.appspot.com), and the
      service, version,
      and instance. Tasks which were created using
      the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name.

      For more information, see
      [How Requests are
      Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).
  *   `instance` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - App instance.

      By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when
      the task is attempted.

      Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if
      [manual scaling is used in App Engine
      Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes).
      App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see
      [App Engine Standard request
      routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
      and [App Engine Flex request
      routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).
  *   `service` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - App service.

      By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default
      service when the task is attempted.

      For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine
      Task Queue API, host is not parsable
      into service,
      version, and
      instance. For example, some tasks
      which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain
      name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If
      host is not parsable, then
      service,
      version, and
      instance are the empty string.
  *   `version` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - App version.

      By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default
      version when the task is attempted.

      For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine
      Task Queue API, host is not parsable
      into service,
      version, and
      instance. For example, some tasks
      which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain
      name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If
      host is not parsable, then
      service,
      version, and
      instance are the empty string.
