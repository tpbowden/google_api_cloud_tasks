  ## Attributes

  *   `condition` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.Expr.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The condition that is associated with this binding.
      NOTE: An unsatisfied condition will not allow user access via current
      binding. Different bindings, including their conditions, are examined
      independently.
  *   `members` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource.
      `members` can have the following values:

         on the internet; with or without a Google account.

      * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone
         who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
