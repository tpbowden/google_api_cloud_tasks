defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.Queue do
  @moduledoc """
  A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage
  how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits,
  retry options, queue types, and others.

  ## Attributes

  *   `appEngineRoutingOverride` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.AppEngineRouting.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Overrides for
      task-level app_engine_routing.
      These settings apply only to
      App Engine tasks in this queue.

      If set, `app_engine_routing_override` is used for all
      App Engine tasks in the queue, no matter what the
      setting is for the
      task-level app_engine_routing.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue,
      after which it becomes output only.

      The queue name.

      The queue name must have the following format:
      `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID`

      * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
         hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).
         For more information, see
         [Identifying
         projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects)
      * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location.
         The list of available locations can be obtained by calling
         ListLocations.
         For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
      * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or
        hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
  *   `purgeTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The last time this queue was purged.

      All tasks that were created before this time
      were purged.

      A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the
      [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud
      Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue).

      Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge
      time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  *   `rateLimits` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.RateLimits.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Rate limits for task dispatches.

      rate_limits and retry_config are
      related because they both control task attempts. However they control task
      attempts in different ways:

      * rate_limits controls the total rate of
        dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the
        queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first
        attempt or a retry).
      * retry_config controls what happens to
        particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is,
        retry_config controls task retries (the
        second attempt, third attempt, etc).

      The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

      * Number of tasks in the queue
      * User-specified throttling: rate_limits,
        retry_config, and the
        queue's state.
      * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service
        Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth
        sudden large traffic spikes.
  *   `retryConfig` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2.Model.RetryConfig.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Settings that determine the retry behavior.

      * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings
        apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks.
        Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks.
      * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry
        settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings
        explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See
        [App Engine
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks).
  *   `state` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The state of the queue.

      `state` can only be changed by called
      PauseQueue,
      ResumeQueue, or uploading
      [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref).
      UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`.
