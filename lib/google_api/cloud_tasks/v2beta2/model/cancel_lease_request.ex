defmodule GoogleApi.CloudTasks.V2beta2.Model.CancelLeaseRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request message for canceling a lease using
  CancelLease.

  ## Attributes

  *   `responseView` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
      returned.

      By default response_view is BASIC; not all
      information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
      payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
      of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
      contains.

      Authorization for FULL requires
      `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
      permission on the Task resource.
  *   `scheduleTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The task's current schedule time, available in the
      schedule_time returned by
      LeaseTasks response or
      RenewLease response. This restriction is
      to ensure that your worker currently holds the lease.
